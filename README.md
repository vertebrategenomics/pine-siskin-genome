# Pine Siskin Reference Genome
This repository contains scripts used to create a reference genome for the Pine Siskin (*Spinus pinus*) organized in the pine-siskin-genome-pipeline/ folder. The workflow includes HiFi read preprocessing, genome assembly and scaffolding, quality assessment, repeat modeling and curation, gene annotation, and visualization of repeat landscapes and synteny.
